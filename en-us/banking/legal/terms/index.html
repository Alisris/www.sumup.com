We are also required to verify the information you provide to us. This verification process may require you to provide us with supporting documentation that we deem appropriate. We may also seek to verify the information by other means. We reserve the right to request additional information and/or signatures from you from time to time.

This prohibition includes any transaction that is illegal in the jurisdiction where you live, in the jurisdiction where the transaction is consummated, or in any other jurisdiction affected by the transaction. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not necessarily mean that transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which the cardholder may be located.

You agree that we may charge fees for overdrafts. For consumer accounts, we will not charge fees for overdrafts caused by ATM withdrawals or one-time debit card transactions if you have not opted-in to that service.

To the extent allowed by law, the Bank will not be liable for and will be excused from failing to process or any delay in processing a transfer of funds (i) if, in the Bank’s sole discretion, processing a transfer would violate or contribute to the violation of any law, regulation or regulatory requirement; or (ii) if processing a transfer, in the Bank’s sole discretion, would cause it to engage in an unsafe and unsound practice.

Neither you nor we will have the right to: (1) have a court or a jury decide the dispute; (2) engage in information-gathering (discovery) to the same extent as in court; (3) participate in a class action in court or in class arbitration; or (4) join or consolidate a claim with claims of any other persons. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. The decision of the arbitrator is final and binding.</p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">As used in this Dispute Resolution Provision, the term “Claim” means any claim, dispute, or controversy between you and Bank, SumUp, or any of their agents or retailers, arising from or relating to the Card, Account, or this Agreement as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us or the relationships resulting from this Agreement, including the validity, enforceability or scope of this Dispute Resolution Provision or the Agreement. “Claim” includes claims of every kind and nature, including but not limited to initial claims, counterclaims, crossclaims and third-party claims and claims based upon contract, tort, fraud and other intentional torts, statutes, regulations, common law and equity. The term “Claim” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and includes, by way of example and without limitation, any claim, dispute or controversy that arises from or relates to (1) your Card or Account; (2) the amount of available funds in the Account; (3) advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related to the Account, goods or services purchased with the Card; (4) the benefits and services related to the Account; and/or (5) your enrollment for any Card. We will not elect to use arbitration under the Dispute Resolution Provision for any Claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court of your state or municipality so long as the Claim is individual and pending only in that court; any appeals from that court will be pursued only in arbitration. As used in this Dispute Resolution Provision, the terms “we” and “us” will for all purposes mean the Bank, SumUp, their respective wholly or majority owned subsidiaries, affiliates, licensees, predecessors, successors, and assigns, and all of their agents, employees, directors and representatives. In addition, for purposes of this Dispute Resolution Provision, “we” or “us” will include any third party using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with any Account (including, but not limited to merchants who accept the Card, third parties who use or provide services, debt collectors and all of their agents, employees, directors and representatives) if, and only if, such third party is named as a co-party with us (or files a Claim with or against us) in connection with a Claim asserted by you. As solely used in this Dispute Resolution Provision, the terms “you” or “yours” will mean all persons or entities approved by us to have and/or use a Card, including but not limited to all persons or entities contractually obligated under any of the Agreements. “Claim” will not include any services provided by SumUp pursuant to its Terms of Service, and any dispute related to the SumUp Terms of Service or services provided thereunder is to be governed by the SumUp Terms of Service.</p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">NEITHER YOU NOR WE ARE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHERS IN ANY COURT ACTION OR ARBITRATION, OR TO INCLUDE IN ANY COURT ACTION OR ARBITRATION ANY DISPUTE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS, OR TO ACT IN ANY ARBITRATION IN THE INTEREST OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY, UNLESS THOSE PERSONS ARE BENEFICIARIES ON YOUR ACCOUNT. THIS IS SO WHETHER OR NOT THE CLAIM HAS BEEN ASSIGNED. FURTHER, NEITHER YOU NOR WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A CLAIM IN COURT, SUBJECT TO THE SECTION TITLED EXCLUDED CLAIMS, OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON A CLAIM, OR TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE CODE OF PROCEDURES OF JAMS OR AAA.</p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">Any Claim will be resolved, upon the election by you or us, by arbitration pursuant to this Dispute Resolution Provision and the code of procedures of the national arbitration organization to which the Claim is referred in effect at the time the Claim is filed. Claims will be referred to either Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as selected by the party electing to use arbitration. If a selection by us of one of these organizations is unacceptable to you, you will have the right within thirty (30) days after you receive notice of our election to select the other organization listed to serve as arbitrator administrator. For a copy of the procedures, to file a Claim or for other information about these organizations, contact them as follows: (1) JAMS at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 92614; website at www.jamsadr.com; and (2) AAA at 335 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017; website at www.adr.org.</p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">If either party elects to resolve a Claim by arbitration, that Claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis. There is no right or authority for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other account holders or other persons similarly situated. The arbitrator’s authority to resolve Claims is limited to Claims between you and us alone, and the arbitrator’s authority to make awards is limited to you and us alone. Furthermore, Claims brought by you against us or by us against you may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with Claims brought by or against someone other than you, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties.</p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence. At your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of all or part of the filing administrative and/or hearing fees for any Claim you initiate as to which you or we seek arbitration. At the conclusion of the arbitration (or any appeal thereof), the arbitrator (or panel) will decide who will ultimately be responsible for paying the filing, administrative and/or hearing fees in connection with the arbitration (or appeal). If and to the extent you incur filing, administrative and/or hearing fees in arbitration, including for any appeal, exceeding the amount they would have been if the Claim had been brought in the state or federal court which is closest to your billing address and would have had jurisdiction over the Claim, we will reimburse you to that extent unless the arbitrator (or panel) determines that the fees were incurred without any substantial justification.</p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">This Dispute Resolution Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16, as it may be amended (the “FAA”). The arbitration will be governed by the applicable United States Code (the “Applicable Code”), except that (to the extent enforceable under the FAA) this Dispute Resolution Provision will control if it is inconsistent with the Applicable Code. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and will honor claims of privilege recognized at law and, at the timely request of either party, will provide a brief written explanation of the basis for the decision. In conducting the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator will not apply the Federal or any state rules of civil procedure or rules of evidence. Either party may submit a request to the arbitrator to expand the scope of discovery allowable under the Applicable Code. The party submitting such a request must provide a copy to the other party, who may submit objections to the arbitrator with a copy of the objections provided to the request party, within fifteen (15) days of receiving the requesting party’s notice. The granting or denial of such request will be at the sole discretion of the arbitrator who will notify the parties of his/her decision within twenty (20) days of the objecting party’s submission. The arbitrator will take reasonable steps to preserve the privacy of individuals, and of business matters. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA. However, any party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same arbitration organization, which will consider anew any aspect of the initial award objected to by the appealing party. The appealing party will have thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award to notify the arbitration organization that it is exercising the right of appeal. The appeal will be filed with the arbitration organization in the form of a dated writing. The arbitration organization will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The arbitration organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel which will conduct arbitration pursuant to the Applicable Code and issue its decision within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of the appellant’s written notice.

You may use your Card to make purchases using your PIN at any merchant with a POS device that displays the Mastercard, Interlink, Maestro, or Cirrus acceptance marks. You may also use your Card to make purchases without your PIN anywhere that Mastercard debit cards are accepted. Provided you have an adequate balance in your Account, you may purchase up to $2,500 worth of goods or services each day using your Card.</p><h4 class="cui-headline-sagu cui-headline-four-m54a css-axuyv7 e1itouxg0"><a id="split-transactions-and-card-not-present-transactions" class="css-177mjip e1itouxg1"> </a><strong class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz cui-body-highlight-kmah css-10dm8y e1itouxg2">Split Transactions and Card-Not-Present Transactions </strong></h4><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">You can instruct a merchant to charge your Card for part of a purchase and pay any remaining amount with cash or another card. This is called a “split transaction.” Some merchants do not permit split transactions. If you wish to conduct a split transaction, you must tell the merchant the exact amount you would like charged to your Card. If you fail to inform the merchant you would like to complete a split transaction and you do not have sufficient available funds in your Account to cover the entire purchase amount, your Card may be declined or may pull funds from your Linked Account. </p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">You may make e-commerce purchases without presenting your Card by providing information from your Card, such as in transactions done by internet or telephone. Conducting transactions in this way has the same legal effect as if you used the physical Card itself. For security reasons, the amount or number of such transactions you may make may be limited.</p><h4 class="cui-headline-sagu cui-headline-four-m54a css-axuyv7 e1itouxg0"><a id="authorization-holds" class="css-177mjip e1itouxg1"> </a><strong class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz cui-body-highlight-kmah css-10dm8y e1itouxg2">Authorization Holds</strong></h4><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">When you use your Card to purchase goods or services or to make a cash back withdrawal transaction, the merchant may attempt to obtain preauthorization for the transaction. If the merchant makes such a request, a “hold” is placed on your Account balance for the amount of the preauthorization request (which may vary in some cases from the amount of the actual purchase, depending on the merchant or purchase type), until the merchant sends the final payment amount of your purchase. During the hold period, you may not have access to the preauthorized amount in your Account. </p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn"> If you fail to make the purchase, or if the actual amount of the purchase is lower than the preauthorization amount, the amount of the temporary hold may exceed the actual amount of your purchase. This temporary hold, and the amount charged to your Account, will eventually be adjusted to the actual amount of your purchase, but it may be up to seven (7) days or more transactions before the adjustment is made. If the preauthorization request varies from the amount of the actual transaction, the actual transaction amount will be debited from your Account, even if this results in your Account balance becoming negative. You remain responsible for any negative balances in your Account.</p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">If you use the Card at an automated fuel dispenser (i.e., a gas station “pay at the pump” transaction), the transaction may be preauthorized for an amount up to $100.00 irrespective of the amount you intend to spend. If the Card is declined, but you have sufficient funds available in your Account, you should use the Card to pay for the purchase inside with the cashier.</p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">If you use the Card at a restaurant, a hotel, for a car rental purchase, or for similar purchases, the transaction may be preauthorized for the purchase amount plus up to twenty percent (20%) to ensure there are sufficient funds available to cover tips or incidental expenses incurred. For transactions at hotels, it may take up to thirty (30) days for the temporary hold to be removed. For transactions at rental car companies, it may take up to sixty (60) days for the temporary hold to be removed. </p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">Some merchants may request an authorization for the amount that they estimate you will spend and place a temporary hold for that amount. This estimated amount is likely to be different (either more or less) than the actual transaction amount. Except as noted above, temporary holds are typically placed for up to three (3) business days, but exact times may vary. If a temporary hold is placed, please note that it may impact your available balance by an amount either more or less than you expected until the transaction posts. We are not responsible for damages or losses of any type, including wrongful dishonor, for any transaction that is not authorized or that is returned unpaid because of a hold.</p><h3 class="cui-headline-sagu cui-headline-three-sgdq css-axuyv7 e1itouxg0"><a id="atm-and-pos-balance-inquiries-and-withdrawals" class="css-177mjip e1itouxg1"> </a><strong class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz cui-body-highlight-kmah css-10dm8y e1itouxg2">ATM and POS Balance Inquiries and Withdrawals</strong></h3><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">With your PIN, you can use your Card to obtain your available Account balance and cash from your Account up to your available Account balance, subject to any applicable transaction limitations, at any ATM or any POS in the United States that displays the Mastercard, Interlink, Maestro or Cirrus acceptance marks. ATMs at which the card may be utilized are not available in all areas and the card will not be functional at all ATMs. Not all merchants will permit you to get cash back through their POS devices. We may charge you a fee to use ATMs. In addition, ATM owner-operators may impose their own fees and lower limits on cash withdrawals and may assess a fee even if you do not complete the transaction. This ATM fee imposed by a third-party is assessed by the individual ATM operator and is not assessed or controlled by us. ATM fees will be charged to your Account. If given the option, select “Checking Account” when using an ATM.

In addition, using your Card and/or PIN (if applicable), you may not exceed $2,500.00 in debit card transactions per day.</p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">SumUp may, at its discretion, place additional limits on the number or total dollar value of purchases, and/or cash withdrawals that you may make with the Card.

The Mastercard currency conversion procedure includes use of either a government-mandated exchange rate, or a wholesale exchange rate selected by Mastercard. The exchange rate Mastercard uses will be a rate in effect on the day the transaction is processed. This rate may differ from the rate in effect on the date of purchase or the date the transaction was posted to your Account.</p><p class="cui-body-o5xe cui-body-one-cjrz css-k4eprn">Please see the fee schedule for applicable foreign transaction fees.
